Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.
